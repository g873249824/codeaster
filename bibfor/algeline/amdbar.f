C AMDBAR:  APPROXIMATE MINIMUM (UMFPACK/MA38-STYLE, EXTERNAL) DEGREE
C          ORDERING ALGORITHM, BUT WITHOUT AGGRESIVE ABSORPTION
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C  VARIATION 2:  MC47-STYLE APPROXIMATE EXTERNAL DEGREE, BUT WITH NO
C  AGGRESIVE ABSORPTION.  THIS IS INCLUDED FOR COMPARISON WITH THE
C  OTHER 5 VARIATIONS.  IT TENDS TO COMPUTE ORDERINGS COMPARABLE TO
C  MC47B/BD, OR SLIGHTLY WORSE IN SOME CASES.  IT TENDS TO BE ABOUT AS
C  FAST AS MC47B/BD.
C
C  WE RECOMMEND USING MC47B/BD INSTEAD OF THIS ROUTINE SINCE MC47B/BD
C  GIVES BETTER RESULTS IN ABOUT THE SAME TIME.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C GIVEN A REPRESENTATION OF THE NONZERO PATTERN OF A SYMMETRIC MATRIX,
C       A, (EXCLUDING THE DIAGONAL) PERFORM AN APPROXIMATE MINIMUM
C       (UMFPACK/MA38-STYLE) DEGREE ORDERING TO COMPUTE A PIVOT ORDER
C       SUCH THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF NONZEROS (FILL-IN) IN THE CHOLESKY
C       FACTORS A = LLT ARE KEPT LOW.  AT EACH STEP, THE PIVOT
C       SELECTED IS THE ONE WITH THE MINIMUM UMFAPACK/MA38-STYLE
C       UPPER-BOUND ON THE EXTERNAL DEGREE.  THIS ROUTINE DOES NOT
C       PERFORM AGGRESIVE ABSORPTION (AS DONE BY MC47B/BD).  AGGRESIVE
C       ABSORPTION IN MC47B/BD IS USED TO TIGHTEN THE BOUND ON THE
C       DEGREE.  THIS CAN RESULT AN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE
C       QUALITY OF THE ORDERING FOR SOME MATRICES.
C
C       THE APPROXIMATE DEGREE ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTED HERE IS THE
C       SYMMETRIC ANALOG OF THE DEGREE UPDATE ALGORITHM IN MA38 AND
C       UMFPACK (THE UNSYMMETRIC-PATTERN MULTIFRONTAL PACKAGE, BOTH BY

C               FEATURES MENTIONED IN THAT PAPER THAT THIS CODE
C               INCLUDES:
C
C       MASS ELIMINATION:
C               YES.  MA27 RELIED ON SUPERVARIABLE DETECTION FOR MASS
C               ELIMINATION.
C       INDISTINGUISHABLE NODES:
C               YES (WE CALL THESE "SUPERVARIABLES").  THIS WAS ALSO IN
C               THE MA27 CODE - ALTHOUGH WE MODIFIED THE METHOD OF
C               DETECTING THEM (THE PREVIOUS HASH WAS THE TRUE DEGREE,
C               WHICH WE NO LONGER KEEP TRACK OF).  A SUPERVARIABLE IS
C               A SET OF ROWS WITH IDENTICAL NONZERO PATTERN.  ALL
C               VARIABLES IN A SUPERVARIABLE ARE ELIMINATED TOGETHER.
C               EACH SUPERVARIABLE HAS AS ITS NUMERICAL NAME THAT OF
C               ONE OF ITS VARIABLES (ITS PRINCIPAL VARIABLE).
C       QUOTIENT GRAPH REPRESENTATION:
C               YES.  WE USE THE TERM "ELEMENT" FOR THE CLIQUES FORMED
C               DURING ELIMINATION.  THIS WAS ALSO IN THE MA27 CODE.
C               THE ALGORITHM CAN OPERATE IN PLACE, BUT IT WILL WORK
C               MORE EFFICIENTLY IF GIVEN SOME "ELBOW ROOM."
C       ELEMENT ABSORPTION:
C               YES.  THIS WAS ALSO IN THE MA27 CODE.
C       EXTERNAL DEGREE:
C               YES.  THE MA27 CODE WAS BASED ON THE TRUE DEGREE.
C       INCOMPLETE DEGREE UPDATE AND MULTIPLE ELIMINATION:
C               NO.  THIS WAS NOT IN MA27, EITHER.  OUR METHOD OF
C               DEGREE UPDATE WITHIN MC47B/BD IS ELEMENT-BASED, NOT
C               VARIABLE-BASED.  IT IS THUS NOT WELL-SUITED FOR USE
C               WITH INCOMPLETE DEGREE UPDATE OR MULTIPLE ELIMINATION.

C INPUT ARGUMENTS (UNALTERED):
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C N:    THE MATRIX ORDER.
C
C       RESTRICTION:  1 .LE. N .LT. (IOVFLO/2)-2

C IWLEN:        THE LENGTH OF IW (1..IWLEN).  ON INPUT, THE MATRIX IS
C       STORED IN IW (1..PFREE-1).  HOWEVER, IW (1..IWLEN) SHOULD BE
C       SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED TO HOLD THE MATRIX, AT
C       LEAST IWLEN .GE. PFREE + N IS RECOMMENDED.  OTHERWISE,
C       EXCESSIVE COMPRESSIONS WILL TAKE PLACE.
C       *** WE DO NOT RECOMMEND RUNNING THIS ALGORITHM WITH ***
C       ***      IWLEN .LT. PFREE + N.                      ***

C       THE ALGORITHM WILL NOT RUN AT ALL IF IWLEN .LT. PFREE-1.
C
C       RESTRICTION: IWLEN .GE. PFREE-1

C IOVFLO:       THE LARGEST POSITIVE INTEGER THAT YOUR COMPUTER CAN
C       REPRESENT (-IOVFLO SHOULD ALSO BE REPRESENTABLE).  ON A 32-BIT
C       COMPUTER WITH 2'S-COMPLEMENT ARITHMETIC,
C       IOVFLO = (2 PUISSANCE 31)-1 = 2,147,483,648.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C INPUT/OUPUT ARGUMENTS:
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C PE:   ON INPUT, PE (I) IS THE INDEX IN IW OF THE START OF ROW I, OR
C       ZERO IF ROW I HAS NO OFF-DIAGONAL NON-ZEROS.
C
C       DURING EXECUTION, IT IS USED FOR BOTH SUPERVARIABLES AND
C       ELEMENTS:
C
C       * PRINCIPAL SUPERVARIABLE I:  INDEX INTO IW OF THE
C               DESCRIPTION OF SUPERVARIABLE I.  A SUPERVARIABLE
C               REPRESENTS ONE OR MORE ROWS OF THE MATRIX
C               WITH IDENTICAL NONZERO PATTERN.
C       * NON-PRINCIPAL SUPERVARIABLE I:  IF I HAS BEEN ABSORBED
C               INTO ANOTHER SUPERVARIABLE J, THEN PE (I) = -J.
C               THAT IS, J HAS THE SAME PATTERN AS I.
C               NOTE THAT J MIGHT LATER BE ABSORBED INTO ANOTHER
C               SUPERVARIABLE J2, IN WHICH CASE PE (I) IS STILL -J,
C               AND PE (J) = -J2.
C       * UNABSORBED ELEMENT E:  THE INDEX INTO IW OF THE DESCRIPTION
C               OF ELEMENT E, IF E HAS NOT YET BEEN ABSORBED BY A
C               SUBSEQUENT ELEMENT.  ELEMENT E IS CREATED WHEN
C               THE SUPERVARIABLE OF THE SAME NAME IS SELECTED AS
C               THE PIVOT.
C       * ABSORBED ELEMENT E:  IF ELEMENT E IS ABSORBED INTO ELEMENT
C               E2, THEN PE (E) = -E2.  THIS OCCURS WHEN THE PATTERN OF
C               E (THAT IS, LE) IS FOUND TO BE A SUBSET OF THE PATTERN
C               OF E2 (THAT IS, LE2).  IF ELEMENT E IS "NULL" (IT HAS
C               NO NONZEROS OUTSIDE ITS PIVOT BLOCK), THEN PE (E) = 0.
C
C       ON OUTPUT, PE HOLDS THE ASSEMBLY TREE/FOREST, WHICH IMPLICITLY
C       REPRESENTS A PIVOT ORDER WITH IDENTICAL FILL-IN AS THE ACTUAL
C       ORDER (VIA A DEPTH-FIRST SEARCH OF THE TREE).
C
C       ON OUTPUT:
C       IF NV (I) .GT. 0, THEN I REPRESENTS A NODE IN THE ASSEMBLY TREE,
C       AND THE PARENT OF I IS -PE (I), OR ZERO IF I IS A ROOT.
C       IF NV (I) = 0, THEN (I,-PE (I)) REPRESENTS AN EDGE IN A
C       SUBTREE, THE ROOT OF WHICH IS A NODE IN THE ASSEMBLY TREE.

C PFREE:        ON INPUT THE TAIL END OF THE ARRAY, IW (PFREE..IWLEN),
C       IS EMPTY, AND THE MATRIX IS STORED IN IW (1..PFREE-1).
C       DURING EXECUTION, ADDITIONAL DATA IS PLACED IN IW, AND PFREE
C       IS MODIFIED SO THAT IW (PFREE..IWLEN) IS ALWAYS THE UNUSED PART
C       OF IW.  ON OUTPUT, PFREE IS SET EQUAL TO THE SIZE OF IW THAT
C       WOULD HAVE BEEN NEEDED FOR NO COMPRESSIONS TO OCCUR.  IF
C       NCMPA IS ZERO, THEN PFREE (ON OUTPUT) IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO
C       IWLEN, AND THE SPACE IW (PFREE+1 ... IWLEN) WAS NOT USED.
C       OTHERWISE, PFREE (ON OUTPUT) IS GREATER THAN IWLEN, AND ALL THE
C       MEMORY IN IW WAS USED.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C INPUT/MODIFIED (UNDEFINED ON OUTPUT):
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C LEN:  ON INPUT, LEN (I) HOLDS THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES IN ROW I OF THE
C       MATRIX, EXCLUDING THE DIAGONAL.  THE CONTENTS OF LEN (1..N)
C       ARE UNDEFINED ON OUTPUT.

C IW:   ON INPUT, IW (1..PFREE-1) HOLDS THE DESCRIPTION OF EACH ROW I
C       IN THE MATRIX.  THE MATRIX MUST BE SYMMETRIC, AND BOTH UPPER
C       AND LOWER TRIANGULAR PARTS MUST BE PRESENT.  THE DIAGONAL MUST
C       NOT BE PRESENT.  ROW I IS HELD AS FOLLOWS:
C
C               LEN (I):  THE LENGTH OF THE ROW I DATA STRUCTURE
C               IW (PE (I) ... PE (I) + LEN (I) - 1):
C                       THE LIST OF COLUMN INDICES FOR NONZEROS
C                       IN ROW I (SIMPLE SUPERVARIABLES), EXCLUDING
C                       THE DIAGONAL.  ALL SUPERVARIABLES START WITH
C                       ONE ROW/COLUMN EACH (SUPERVARIABLE I IS JUST
C                       ROW I).
C               IF LEN (I) IS ZERO ON INPUT, THEN PE (I) IS IGNORED
C               ON INPUT.
C
C               NOTE THAT THE ROWS NEED NOT BE IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER,
C               AND THERE MAY BE EMPTY SPACE BETWEEN THE ROWS.
C
C       DURING EXECUTION, THE SUPERVARIABLE I EXPERIENCES FILL-IN.
C       THIS IS REPRESENTED BY PLACING IN I A LIST OF THE ELEMENTS
C       THAT CAUSE FILL-IN IN SUPERVARIABLE I:
C
C               LEN (I):  THE LENGTH OF SUPERVARIABLE I
C               IW (PE (I) ... PE (I) + ELEN (I) - 1):
C                       THE LIST OF ELEMENTS THAT CONTAIN I.  THIS LIST
C                       IS KEPT SHORT BY REMOVING ABSORBED ELEMENTS.
C               IW (PE (I) + ELEN (I) ... PE (I) + LEN (I) - 1):
C                       THE LIST OF SUPERVARIABLES IN I.  THIS LIST
C                       IS KEPT SHORT BY REMOVING NONPRINCIPAL
C                       VARIABLES, AND ANY ENTRY J THAT IS ALSO
C                       CONTAINED IN AT LEAST ONE OF THE ELEMENTS
C                       (J IN LE) IN THE LIST FOR I (E IN ROW I).
C
C       WHEN SUPERVARIABLE I IS SELECTED AS PIVOT, WE CREATE AN
C       ELEMENT E OF THE SAME NAME (E=I):
C
C               LEN (E):  THE LENGTH OF ELEMENT E
C               IW (PE (E) ... PE (E) + LEN (E) - 1):
C                       THE LIST OF SUPERVARIABLES IN ELEMENT E.
C
C       AN ELEMENT REPRESENTS THE FILL-IN THAT OCCURS WHEN SUPERVARIABLE
C       I IS SELECTED AS PIVOT (WHICH REPRESENTS THE SELECTION OF ROW I
C       AND ALL NON-PRINCIPAL VARIABLES WHOSE PRINCIPAL VARIABLE IS I).
C       WE USE THE TERM LE TO DENOTE THE SET OF ALL SUPERVARIABLES
C       IN ELEMENT E.  ABSORBED SUPERVARIABLES AND ELEMENTS ARE PRUNED
C       FROM THESE LISTS WHEN COMPUTATIONALLY CONVENIENT.
C
C       CAUTION:  THE INPUT MATRIX IS OVERWRITTEN DURING COMPUTATION.
C       THE CONTENTS OF IW ARE UNDEFINED ON OUTPUT.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C OUTPUT (NEED NOT BE SET ON INPUT):
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C NV:   DURING EXECUTION, ABS (NV (I)) IS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF ROWS
C       THAT ARE REPRESENTED BY THE PRINCIPAL SUPERVARIABLE I.  IF I IS
C       A NONPRINCIPAL VARIABLE, THEN NV (I) = 0.  INITIALLY,
C       NV (I) = 1 FOR ALL I.  NV (I) .LT. 0 SIGNIFIES THAT I IS A
C       PRINCIPAL VARIABLE IN THE PATTERN LME OF THE CURRENT PIVOT
C       ELEMENT ME.  ON OUTPUT, NV (E) HOLDS THE TRUE DEGREE OF ELEMENT
C       E AT THE TIME IT WAS CREATED (INCLUDING THE DIAGONAL PART).

C NCMPA:        THE NUMBER OF TIMES IW WAS COMPRESSED.  IF THIS IS
C       EXCESSIVE, THEN THE EXECUTION TOOK LONGER THAN WHAT COULD HAVE
C       BEEN.  TO REDUCE NCMPA, TRY INCREASING IWLEN TO BE 10% OR 20%
C       LARGER THAN THE VALUE OF PFREE ON INPUT (OR AT LEAST
C       IWLEN .GE. PFREE + N).  THE FASTEST PERFORMANCE WILL BE
C       OBTAINED WHEN NCMPA IS RETURNED AS ZERO.  IF IWLEN IS SET TO
C       THE VALUE RETURNED BY PFREE ON *OUTPUT*, THEN NO COMPRESSIONS
C       WILL OCCUR.

C ELEN: SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF IW ABOVE.  AT THE START OF EXECUTION,
C       ELEN (I) IS SET TO ZERO.  DURING EXECUTION, ELEN (I) IS THE
C       NUMBER OF ELEMENTS IN THE LIST FOR SUPERVARIABLE I.  WHEN E
C       BECOMES AN ELEMENT, ELEN (E) = -NEL IS SET, WHERE NEL IS THE
C       CURRENT STEP OF FACTORIZATION.  ELEN (I) = 0 IS DONE WHEN I
C       BECOMES NONPRINCIPAL.
C
C       FOR VARIABLES, ELEN (I) .GE. 0 HOLDS UNTIL JUST BEFORE THE
C       PERMUTATION VECTORS ARE COMPUTED.  FOR ELEMENTS,
C       ELEN (E) .LT. 0 HOLDS.
C
C       ON OUTPUT ELEN (1..N) HOLDS THE INVERSE PERMUTATION (THE SAME
C       AS THE 'INVP' ARGUMENT IN SPARSPAK).  THAT IS, IF K = ELEN (I),
C       THEN ROW I IS THE KTH PIVOT ROW.  ROW I OF A APPEARS AS THE
C       (ELEN(I))-TH ROW IN THE PERMUTED MATRIX, PAPT.

C LAST: IN A DEGREE LIST, LAST (I) IS THE SUPERVARIABLE PRECEDING I,
C       OR ZERO IF I IS THE HEAD OF THE LIST.  IN A HASH BUCKET,
C       LAST (I) IS THE HASH KEY FOR I.  LAST (HEAD (HASH)) IS ALSO
C       USED AS THE HEAD OF A HASH BUCKET IF HEAD (HASH) CONTAINS A
C       DEGREE LIST (SEE HEAD, BELOW).
C
C       ON OUTPUT, LAST (1..N) HOLDS THE PERMUTATION (THE SAME AS THE
C       'PERM' ARGUMENT IN SPARSPAK).  THAT IS, IF I = LAST (K), THEN
C       ROW I IS THE KTH PIVOT ROW.  ROW LAST (K) OF A IS THE K-TH ROW
C       IN THE PERMUTED MATRIX, PAPT.

C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C LOCAL (NOT INPUT OR OUTPUT - USED ONLY DURING EXECUTION):
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C DEGREE:       IF I IS A SUPERVARIABLE, THEN DEGREE (I) HOLDS THE
C       CURRENT APPROXIMATION OF THE EXTERNAL DEGREE OF ROW I (AN UPPER
C       BOUND).  THE EXTERNAL DEGREE IS THE NUMBER OF NONZEROS IN ROW I,
C       MINUS ABS (NV (I)) (THE DIAGONAL PART).  THE BOUND IS EQUAL TO
C       THE EXTERNAL DEGREE IF ELEN (I) IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO TWO.
C
C       WE ALSO USE THE TERM "EXTERNAL DEGREE" FOR ELEMENTS E TO REFER
C       TO CARD(LE / LME).  IF E IS AN ELEMENT,
C       THEN DEGREE (E) HOLDS CARD(LE),
C       WHICH IS THE DEGREE OF THE OFF-DIAGONAL PART OF THE ELEMENT E
C       (NOT INCLUDING THE DIAGONAL PART).

C HEAD: HEAD IS USED FOR DEGREE LISTS.  HEAD (DEG) IS THE FIRST
C       SUPERVARIABLE IN A DEGREE LIST (ALL SUPERVARIABLES I IN A
C       DEGREE LIST DEG HAVE THE SAME APPROXIMATE DEGREE, NAMELY,
C       DEG = DEGREE (I)).  IF THE LIST DEG IS EMPTY THEN
C       HEAD (DEG) = 0.
C
