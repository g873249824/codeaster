!   Define some constant values shared by several subroutines
!   (C or Fortran 90)
!  
!   Constant values to check status in parallel
!  
!   ST_OK and ST_ER can be used for all boolean tests.
!  
!   ST_OK and others ST_xxx values allow binary operations to be more
!   precise.
!  
!   ST_ER and ST_xxx constants must not be used together.
!  
!   ST_ER_PR0 : error on processor #0
!   ST_ER_OTH : error on another processor
!   ST_UN_OTH : undefined status for another processor
!   ST_EXCEPT : not a fatal error, an exception
!
!   ST_TAG_CHK : mpi communication tag for the check step of the status
!   ST_TAG_CNT : mpi communication tag for the continue or stop
!   ST_TAG_ALR : mpi communication tag for the alarm check
