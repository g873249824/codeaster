C     SUBROUTINE HYBRD2
C
C     THE PURPOSE OF HYBRD2 IS TO FIND A ZERO OF A SYSTEM OF
C     N NONLINEAR FUNCTIONS IN N VARIABLES BY A MODIFICATION
C     OF THE POWELL HYBRID METHOD. THIS IS DONE BY USING THE
C     MORE GENERAL NONLINEAR EQUATION SOLVER HYBRD. THE USER
C     MUST PROVIDE A SUBROUTINE WHICH CALCULATES THE FUNCTIONS.
C     THE JACOBIAN IS THEN CALCULATED BY A FORWARD-DIFFERENCE
C     APPROXIMATION.
C
C     THE SUBROUTINE STATEMENT IS
C
C       SUBROUTINE HYBRD2(FCN,N,X,FVEC,TOL,INFO,WA,LWA)
C
C     WHERE
C
C       FCN IS THE NAME OF THE USER-SUPPLIED SUBROUTINE WHICH
C         CALCULATES THE FUNCTIONS. FCN MUST BE DECLARED
C         IN AN EXTERNAL STATEMENT IN THE USER CALLING
C         PROGRAM, AND SHOULD BE WRITTEN AS FOLLOWS.
C
C         SUBROUTINE FCN(N,X,FVEC,IFLAG)
C         INTEGER N,IFLAG
C         REAL*8 X(N),FVEC(N)
C         ----------
C         CALCULATE THE FUNCTIONS AT X AND
C         RETURN THIS VECTOR IN FVEC.
C         ---------
C         RETURN
C         END
C
C         THE VALUE OF IFLAG SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED BY FCN UNLESS
C         THE USER WANTS TO TERMINATE EXECUTION OF HYBRD1.
C         IN THIS CASE SET IFLAG TO A NEGATIVE INTEGER.
C
C       N IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE SET TO THE NUMBER
C         OF FUNCTIONS AND VARIABLES.
C
C       X IS AN ARRAY OF LENGTH N. ON INPUT X MUST CONTAIN
C         AN INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE SOLUTION VECTOR. ON OUTPUT X
C         CONTAINS THE FINAL ESTIMATE OF THE SOLUTION VECTOR.
C
C       FVEC IS AN OUTPUT ARRAY OF LENGTH N WHICH CONTAINS
C         THE FUNCTIONS EVALUATED AT THE OUTPUT X.
C
C       TOL IS A NONNEGATIVE INPUT VARIABLE. TERMINATION OCCURS
C         WHEN THE ALGORITHM ESTIMATES THAT THE RELATIVE ERROR
C         BETWEEN X AND THE SOLUTION IS AT MOST TOL.
C
C       INFO IS AN INTEGER OUTPUT VARIABLE. IF THE USER HAS
C         TERMINATED EXECUTION, INFO IS SET TO THE (NEGATIVE)
C         VALUE OF IFLAG. SEE DESCRIPTION OF FCN. OTHERWISE,
C         INFO IS SET AS FOLLOWS.
C
C         INFO = 0   IMPROPER INPUT PARAMETERS.
C
C         INFO = 1   ALGORITHM ESTIMATES THAT THE RELATIVE ERROR
C                    BETWEEN X AND THE SOLUTION IS AT MOST TOL.
C
C         INFO = 2   NUMBER OF CALLS TO FCN HAS REACHED OR EXCEEDED
C                    200*(N+1).
C
C         INFO = 3   TOL IS TOO SMALL. NO FURTHER IMPROVEMENT IN
C                    THE APPROXIMATE SOLUTION X IS POSSIBLE.
C
C         INFO = 4   ITERATION IS NOT MAKING GOOD PROGRESS.
C
C       WA IS A WORK ARRAY OF LENGTH LWA.
C
C       LWA IS A POSITIVE INTEGER INPUT VARIABLE NOT LESS THAN
C         (N*(3*N+13))/2.
